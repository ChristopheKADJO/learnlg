Side project to keep a history of translations by category (EN-ES). This was done using the Django framework with mostly class-based views. This open-source part shows the implementation of the following functions:

- Account creation (With or without Google CAPTCHA)
- Log in (With or without Google CAPTCHA)
- Log out
- Delete account
- Setting up a custom file for 404 and 403 errors

[The complete project](https://learnlg.pythonanywhere.com/)
## ‚û°Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Client:** Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JS

**Server:** Python 3.10 (Django 4.0)


**API**: Google CAPTCHA, (and for complete version DeepL API)


## ‚û°Ô∏è Required

- Have at least python 3.10 on your computer
- If you want to use Google CAPTCHA: have a public key and a private key for using Google CAPTCHA. [Here is a video showing how to create this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqDW69BSdEo) (it is not mandatory I have planned to launch the project without also)

## ‚û°Ô∏è Running

#### Introduction

Clone the project and check if everything is correct
